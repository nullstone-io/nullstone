# Nullstone

Nullstone is a Heroku-like developer platform launched on your cloud accounts.
We offer a simple developer experience for teams that want to use their own IaC tools like Terraform.

This repository contains code for the Nullstone CLI which is used to manage Nullstone from the command line.
This includes creating and deploying app, domains, and datastore as well as creating and managing Terraform workspaces.
