# Nullstone

Nullstone is a Heroku-like developer platform launched on your cloud accounts.
We offer a simple developer experience for teams that want to use Infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform.

This repository contains code for the Nullstone CLI which is used to manage Nullstone from the command line.
This includes creating and deploying app, domains, and datastore as well as creating and managing Terraform workspaces.

## How it works

The Nullstone platform operates similar to a developer platform that is internally built and used at large tech companies.
It consists of a UI, API, and CLI to serve both software engineers and platform engineers.
Software engineers use official Nullstone modules combined with modules built by their own platform engineers to launch and configure their application.
Platform engineers utilize the Nullstone platform to codify and administer infrastructure architectures for their teams without worrying about building user interfaces.
